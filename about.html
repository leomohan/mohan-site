        <h2>Hi, I’m Mohan Krishnamurthy</h2>
        <p>
          I’m an author, cybersecurity strategist, and eternal student of life.  
          Over the past two decades I have written books in English and Tamil spanning technology, spirituality, management and humour.
        </p>
        <p>
          My day job keeps me busy advising organisations on how to stay safe in the digital age; my nights are spent crafting stories and tools that help people learn, laugh and reflect.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I’m not writing or coding, you’ll find me on a flight to a new country, camera in hand, ready to capture the world one frame at a time.
        </p>
        <hr>
        From a Small Town to a World of Words and Technology I come from a modest, close-knit town where the rhythm of life was shaped by academics, cultural activities, and an ever-present sense of healthy competition. Like many boys from a middle-class family, my early years were filled with a mix of traditional values and growing curiosity — I attended Hindi classes, learnt Carnatic music, participated in elocution contests, essay writing, skits, dramas, and even performed Villu Pattu (bow song), a cherished folk art of Tamil Nadu.<p></p>
<p>In small towns, everything is interconnected — schools, tuition centers, relatives, and even aspirations. A typical visit to a family friend often included impromptu quizzes in grammar or general knowledge to test how the host’s children were doing. Comparisons were inevitable: “My son stood first in the district last year... how’s yours doing in Maths?” But these subtle pressures also nurtured excellence. Academic performance was expected — but so was active participation in extracurricular pursuits.
</p><p>My father, a respected senior officer in the Postal Department, and my mother, a well-loved tailoring instructor, were both influential figures in the community. My sister was an accomplished Bharatanatyam dancer, and as a result, we often found ourselves in the spotlight, with all the expectations that came with it.
</p>One moment that stands out in my memory is seeing my photograph in a local newspaper for securing first rank in the educational district. That recognition encouraged me to dream bigger — and I chose to pursue Computer Science, a pioneering choice back then. I was possibly among the first batch of Computer Science students in Tamil Nadu, learning BASIC, FORTRAN, and a glimpse of computer hardware. It turned out to be a defining decision, setting me on a lifelong path in the IT industry.
</p><p></p>Ironically, I once aspired to be an English teacher — something I still find fascinating — but I couldn’t see myself teaching a single subject for life. Still, the passion for teaching never left. It stayed with me throughout my journey, allowing me to travel abroad, conduct workshops, deliver technical sessions, and connect with people across cultures — experiences that few other professions could have offered.
</p><p></p>Today, my passions still revolve around reading, writing (both fiction and technical), and training. But to teach or write effectively, one needs depth — and that’s where my reading habit proved invaluable. In the early years of my career, I went on to earn certifications from over 20 leading IT vendors across more than 50 products and technologies. That gave me not just credibility, but also the content to speak, write, and train meaningfully.
</p><p></p>There’s still so much to explore, share, and express. If you’ve found something of value in my work — or would simply like to connect — feel free to drop me a message. I’d love to hear from you.
</p><p></p>Thank you for stopping by!
</p><p></p>~ Mohan
